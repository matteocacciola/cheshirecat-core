    Tweedledum is the plugin manager of the Lizard. It is responsible for:

    - Activating a plugin at a system level

    Notes:
    ------
    Tweedledum is the one that knows about the plugins, the hooks, the tools and the forms. It is the one that
    executes the hooks and the tools, and the one that loads the forms. It:
    - loads and execute plugins
    - enter into the plugin folder and loads everything that is decorated or named properly
    - orders plugged in hooks by name and priority
    - exposes functionality to the lizard and cats to execute hooks and tools
