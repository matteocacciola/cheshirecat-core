# Origin

This project originated as a fork of the Cheshire Cat AI core (https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/core).

It has since evolved independently with significant architectural and functional changes.

# Why use the Grinning Cat?
The Grinning Cat is a framework to build custom AI agents:

- 🤖 Build your own AI agent in minutes, not months
- 🧠 Make it smart with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- 🏆 Multi-modality, to build the RAG with any kind of documents
- 💬 Multi-tenancy, to manage multiple chatbots at the same time, each with its own settings, plugins, LLMs, etc.
- ⚡️ API first, to easily add a conversational layer to your app
- ☁️ Cloud Ready, working even with horizontal autoscaling
- 🔐 Secure by design, with API Key and granular permissions
- 🏗 Production ready, cloud native, and scalable
- 🐋 100% dockerized, to run anywhere
- 🛠 Easily extendable with plugins
- 🧩 Built-in plugins
  - 🪛 Extend core components (file managers, LLMs, vector databases)
  - ✂️ Customizable chunking and embedding
  - 🛠 Custom tools, forms, endpoints, MCP clients
  - 🪛 LLM callbacks
- 🌐 Customizable integration of **MCP clients**, such as LangSmith or LlamaIndex 
- 🏛 Easy to use Admin Panel (available with the repository [matteocacciola/grinning-cat-admin](https://www.github.com/matteocacciola/grinning-cat-admin))
- 🦄 Easy to understand [docs](https://deepwiki.com/matteocacciola/grinning-cat-core)
- 🌍 Supports any language model via LangChain

We are committed to openness, privacy and creativity, we want to bring AI to the long tail. If you want to know more

# Key differences of this version
The current version is a multi-tenant fork of the original [Cheshire Cat](https://www.github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/core).
The main differences are reported in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

# Quickstart
To make Grinning Cat run on your machine, you just need [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 1865:80 ghcr.io/matteocacciola/grinning-cat-core:latest
```
- Chat with the Grinning Cat by downloading the [Admin Panel](https://www.github.com/matteocacciola/grinning-cat-admin).
- Try out the REST API on [localhost:1865/docs](http://localhost:1865/docs).

This fork is intended as a microservice.

As a first thing, set the **Embedder** for the Grinning Cat. A favourite **LLM** must be set for each chatbot; each
chatbot can have its own language model, with custom settings.
Everything can be done via the [Admin Panel](https://www.github.com/matteocacciola/grinning-cat-admin) or via the REST API endpoints.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following `core plugins` are enabled by default:
> - `Conversation History`: to store and retrieve the conversation history;
> - `Factories`: extending objects like LLMs, Embedders, File Managers, Chunkers;
> - `Interactions`: add the interaction handler to the language model;
> - `March Hare`: handling events via RabbitMQ;
> - `Memory`: interacting with Working Memory and adding a handler to trace the activities of the Embedder;
> - `Multimodality`: a plugin that adds multimodal capabilities to the Grinning Cat framework, enabling the processing of images;
> - `White Rabbit`: cron and schedule tasks;
> - `Why`: add the context and the reasoning behind the answers of the LLM.
> - `Analytics`: recover the analytics data about the usage of the Grinning Cat, which depends on the `Interactions` and `Memory` plugins.
>
> You can disable one or more (e.g., `March Hare` if you don't need to autoscale over cloud PODs) by using the Admin Toggle endpoint.

Enjoy the Grinning Cat!

# Admin panel and UI widget
You can install an admin panel by using the [`grinning-cat-admin`](https://www.github.com/matteocacciola/grinning-cat-admin) repository.
The admin panel is a separate project that allows you to manage the Grinning Cat and its settings, plugins, and chatbots.
It is built with Streamlit and is designed to be easy to use and customizable.

# API Usage

## For Streaming Responses (Real-time chat)
- **Use WebSocket connection** at `/ws`, `/ws/{agent_id}` or `/ws/{agent_id}/{chat_id}`; add the token or the API key as
a querystring parameter with the syntax `?token=...`
- Receive tokens in real-time as they're generated: message type `chat_token` for individual tokens; message type `chat`
for complete responses

## For Non-Streaming Responses (Simple API calls)
- **Use HTTP POST** to `/message`
- Receive complete response in single API call
- Better for integrations, batch processing, or simple request/response patterns

# Webhooks

Some activities are currently asynchronous: you can register a webhook to be notified when they are completed.
Currently, the following events are supported:
- `knowledge_source_loaded`, triggered when a knowledge source is loaded;
- `plugin_installed`, triggered when a plugin is installed;
- `plugin_uninstalled`, triggered when a plugin is uninstalled.

To register a webhook, use the `/webhooks` endpoint with a `POST` request. You can specify the event type and the URL
to be called when the event occurs. To register a webhook,, you need to provide the following parameters:
- `event`: the event type to listen for (e.g., `knowledge_source_loaded`, `plugin_installed`, `plugin_uninstalled`);
- `url`: the URL to be called when the event occurs;
- `header_key`: the header key to be used for authentication;
- `secret`: the secret to be used for authentication.

Likewise you can register a webhook, you can delete it by using the `/webhooks` endpoint with a `DELETE` request and
the same payload as the `POST` request.

The webhook will be called by the Grinning Cat with a `POST` request, authenticated with the provided header and secret
and containing one of the following payloads:
- `knowledge_source_loaded`:
```json
{
  "agent": <the agent id>,
  "chat": <the chat id>,
  "source": <the knowledge source id>,
  "points": <the list of metadata of the stored points>,
  "success": <true if the operation was successful, false otherwise>
}
```
- `plugin_installed`:
```json
{
  "plugin_id": <the id of the installed plugin,
  "success": <true if the operation was successful, false otherwise>
}
```
- `plugin_uninstalled`:
```json
{
  "plugin_id": <the id of the uninstalled plugin>,
  "success": <true if the operation was successful, false otherwise>
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you do not use the API Key to communicate with the Grinning Cat, you need to be authenticated as an user with
> SYSTEM:WRITE permission to register or delete webhooks.
> 
> Do not forget to specify the `X-Agent-ID` header for registering webhooks for the `knowledge_source_loaded` event.

# Compatibility 
This new version is no more completely compatible with the original version, since the architecture has been changed.
Please, refer to [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) for more information.

# Best practices

## Custom endpoints and permissions

When implementing custom endpoints, you can use the `@endpoint` decorator to create a new endpoint. Please, refer to the
[documentation](https://deepwiki.com/matteocacciola/grinning-cat-core) for more information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Each implemented custom endpoint must use the `check_permissions` method to authenticate**. See this
[`example`](https://github.com/matteocacciola/grinning-cat-core/blob/main/tests/mocks/mock_plugin/mock_endpoint.py#L28).

```
</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A new feature has been added to the plugins of the Grinning Cat: the possibility to **list the dependencies on other plugins**. This feature allows specifying that a plugin requires other plugins to be installed to work properly. This feature is optional, but it is recommended to use it to avoid issues with missing dependencies. To specify the dependencies of a plugin, you can use the `dependencies` attribute in the `plugin.json` file, listing the names of the plugins that the current plugin requires.
